# PolygonDrawing
A simple code which uses as graphic library WinBGIm and draws a polygon (and it's diagonals).
At first, the program asks you if you want it to draw only the last polygon with the specified number of sides, by pressing "1",
or all the polygons with fewer sides in ascending order, by pressing , "2".
After that the program asks you if you want it to draw the diagonals as well (y=yes, n=no).
